The Count is a software package for the evolutionary analysis of homolog family sizes (phylogenetic profiles), or other copy-number-type characters. The principal data consist of the homolog family sizes across multiple genomes: for each (gene) family, the table gives the number of homologs ("copy number") identified in each genome.
