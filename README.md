The Count is a software package for the evolutionary analysis of homolog family sizes (phylogenetic profiles), or other copy-number-type characters. The principal data consist of the homolog family sizes across multiple genomes: for each (gene) family, the table gives the number of homologs ("copy number") identified in each genome.
Count is implemented in Java: you need at least Java SE 13. Download CountXXIII.jar in the latest release and run as java -jar CountXXIII.jar for the Graphical User Interface. CountXXIIIslim contains only the class files and images; the main jar contains also the code and its javadoc. On MacOS, you can also install it as an application using the package installer.
